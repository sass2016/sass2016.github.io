                <p>Anonymous story:</p>
                <p>"Body image is a far more complex issue that does not exist within a vacuum by itself. Instead it is intertwined with myriad issues that stem from our own acceptance or rejection of information presented to us throughout the course of our lives. I grew up in the 70's. During that time, being ultra-thin was the accepted 'ideal'. Poor and unable/unaware of healthy alternatives, I became over-weight. Entering into 7th grade I had a 42" waist and stood 5'5" tall. My parents would often refer to me as 'a husky boy'. My older sister was embarrassed by my weight and I would hear her tell her friends that I was a 'fat fart.' I did not look like the 'idols' and 'models' our society presented to me. The ones I associated with were the 'jokes' and comedic relief in movies, ads, and television. In so many ways, I accepted this role which lead to further depression, self ridicule and more struggles. Late in my 7th grade year, I remember sitting in the school cafeteria, alone, and thinking about the people surrounding me. I questioned why I was allowing their thoughts and opinions to dictate who and what I wanted to be. I looked forward in my life and asked myself if I wanted to or planned to be around these same people 10, 20, 30 years from now. It was then that I realized, I really did not care what they thought about me. I do not mean that in a flippant way. Their thoughts about me did not make me is what I mean to say. I am not who other people think I am. This revelation began the process of freeing me, however, I will still a slave to the overwhelming media. I started exercising, joining sports teams, and became obsessed with my eating habits. I lost weight, gained muscle, but never was satisfied with the way I looked even when I reached a 6' height, 24" waist, and weighed in at 127 pounds. Although sports had provided me with the weight loss and muscle gain, acceptance was still not in my heart. I looked in the mirror and saw imperfections. I tried sculpting every inch in vane. The problem was not in what I looked like, but who I saw myself to be. I needed to change the way I viewed myself. A teacher asked me to sit and draw a self-portrait. It was the most painful experience. Over the next few months she had me draw one after another. She forced me to really look at who I was, what I looked like, and to accept each part of me as beautiful. I began to see my 'flaws' as 'unique treasures' and my body as art itself. Not because it was perfect, but because it wasn't. Michaelangelo's 'David' has many known and observable 'flaws', but its these flaws that make it all the more beautiful. Once I began to see that shapes and forms were beautiful, I began to accept and love the uniqueness of every shape and form I could see. It went further. I saw a 'blessed harmony' develop between things. An elderly person with sags, wrinkles, and wiry hair gave off the beauty of time, history, experience, and the uniqueness unmatched by any other. A plumb new born demonstrated the newness and purity of life unaffected by the weights and torrents of the world. Our bodies are stories, books, catalogs of the person. We are surrounded by a massive library of stories yet to be discovered and appreciated for the exquisite work of art they are. Who is the media, public, or supressor to tell me which books to enjoy, and which I will be? 'I am fearfully and wonderfully made.' So now age is setting in. My body has begun to wrinkle, sag, scar, and age from the years of sun exposure, hard days, and numerous experiences. But my body is just the cover of a book well read, well traveled, and enjoyed. The stories within are who make me, define who I am, and reveal my worth. It took way too long to realize this, but until society stops idealizing a false 'ideal', I fear this issue will continue, it will morph and reveal itself in numerous fashions."
                <p>Anonymous story:</p>
                <p>"Prior to my body image issues, I was a happy, healthy child, face stuck down a jar of nutella. I had no concept of self consciousness, no idea what low esteem felt like. My mother bought me "Body Book for Girls" as a way to start a conversation about puberty. We were reading it one night and we got to the page that talked about eating disorders. That is something I will never have, I have thought. If only I was wrong. In the middle of seventh grade, I started working out with DVDs by Denise Austin. I started being concerned about whether some part of my body looked fat. I started noticing my reflection in mirrors, subway windows, shiny cars, and every time, I did not feel beautiful. I began to wear heavy make up to cover up my acne-stricken face. I made rules about acceptable foods and unacceptable foods, some of which had little scientific basis. I still, however, bought oreos every day and ate what my parents prepared. Then came summer. I decided to become attractive. I learned about calories, diets, work out routines to target specific body parts. I went to restaurants with my parents and sat in front of an empty plate because GOD FORBID I eat something I don't know the calories of. I wrote myself a menu in thin green sharpie and put it on the refrigerator. The greatest amount of calories I could get from the menu was around 900. My appearance was changing and I loved it. Except it was also destroying me. My hair was falling out and my twiggy arms were covered in a downy fluff. I was always cold. I was always tired. I was dizzy, floating in some sort of subconscious state. I was indeed thin, but I never felt beautiful. I became a very isolated person. I would walk to and from school alone, freezing in 60 degree weather. I knew I was sick then, and yet somehow I enjoyed this awful condition. I've come to understand that an eating disorder is like a mean friend, an abusive lover - it was destroying me, but at the end of the day, I knew that it was there and it would always accept me in spite of everything else. However, there is a way out. Recovery was hard and many times, I wanted to turn back. I hated seeing myself become healthier because healthier meant fatter in my sick mind. Over time, I came to understand that people will love me regardless of my weight. It was hard, but I have learned to look in the mirror and like what I see. I have learned to carry myself with confidence."</p>

                <p>Talia's story:</p>
                <p>"My father is 6’10 and my mom is 5’9. My siblings range from heights 5’11 to 6’6 and I’m 6’2. I’ve always been taller than my friends and my classmates. I’m usually not comfortable with my height and I stopped being comfortable with it when I was like in the 3rd grade and all the boys would pick on me because I was taller than them. And because I’m so tall a girl got big feet. I wear a size 12 in women and a size 10-11 in men. It’s hard finding shoes that fit so I just wear sneakers all the time. It’s hard finding jeans that don’t high water so they’re always cuffed and I hate wearing dresses because not only are they short on me because of my height, but they ride up in the back because of my butt. I’m not comfortable with my height because people have talked down to me about it and it just made me feel uncomfortable. I’ve been told that I’m better off being a lesbian because no guy would ever like a tall girl. Or that if you’re over 5’9 you’re basically a guy and don’t have any business dating one. Growing up I loved dance and there were times when people would ask me if I played basketball and I’d say no and they’d tell me it’s a waste of height. With that being said, I forced myself to play basketball and that why I always kept quitting. (But it’s okay now. I actually like it.) I’m told (even my father said this) that I can’t and shouldn’t wear heels because I’m already so tall but I like wearing heels so I don’t care if people have a problem with it or take it personal. There’s been times when boys mistaken me all the time for a boy based on the certain clothing I wear. I just feel like if you’re a guy or even a girl you shouldn’t talk down someone who’s taller and say rude things. I try my best to feel comfortable with my height but it’s hard to when you tower over everyone and you’re still growing at that. "</p>
